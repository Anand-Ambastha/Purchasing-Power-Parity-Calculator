# Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) - Economics

## Overview

The **Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)** is an economic theory that suggests that in the absence of transportation costs and other trade barriers, the exchange rate between two currencies should equal the ratio of the price levels of a fixed basket of goods and services in the two countries. This helps to compare the relative value of currencies and measure how much a currency can buy in different countries.

This project is a **PPP Calculator** that allows users to compute the Purchasing Power Parity between two countries using their exchange rates and price level data.

## Understanding Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)

### What is Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)?

**Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)** is an economic theory which suggests that in the absence of transportation costs and other trade barriers, the exchange rate between two currencies should equal the ratio of the price levels of a fixed basket of goods and services in the two countries. PPP provides a way to compare the relative value of currencies and measure how much a currency can buy in different countries, taking into account the differences in price levels.

PPP is one of the most important concepts in international economics and is widely used to compare the standard of living between countries. It is also used to evaluate whether a currency is overvalued or undervalued compared to another.

### How Does PPP Work?

The PPP theory assumes that in an ideal world, after adjusting for exchange rates, the same basket of goods would have the same price in different countries. This concept is based on the "law of one price," which states that identical goods should sell for the same price when expressed in a common currency, when there are no transportation costs or trade barriers.

#### Key Components of PPP:

1. **Price Level**: This refers to the average price of a basket of goods and services in a given country. The basket typically includes food, clothing, housing, and other consumer goods.
  
2. **Exchange Rate**: This is the rate at which one currency can be exchanged for another. The exchange rate plays a crucial role in PPP, as it allows the comparison of the purchasing power of different currencies.

3. **Basket of Goods**: The selection of goods and services used to calculate the price level of a country. These goods and services are assumed to be the same in all countries, which is key to comparing the PPP between nations.

### PPP Formula

The formula for calculating PPP is simple but crucial in understanding how PPP works:
PPP = Price in Domestic Currency / Price in Foreign Currency

Where:
- **Price in Domestic Currency**: The cost of the basket of goods in the domestic country.
- **Price in Foreign Currency**: The cost of the same basket of goods in the foreign country.

Alternatively, PPP can also be expressed in terms of exchange rates:
PPP = Exchange Rate of Foreign to Domestic Currency / Exchange Rate of Domestic to Foreign Currency

This formula shows the relationship between the exchange rate and the price levels of two countries.

### Real-World Application of PPP

PPP is widely used by economists and international organizations to compare the relative value of currencies. One of the primary applications of PPP is to calculate the **PPP exchange rate**, which is the exchange rate that would equalize the price levels of two countries.

For example, if a loaf of bread costs $2 in the U.S. and £1.50 in the U.K., PPP suggests that the exchange rate between the dollar and the pound should be:

PPP Exchange Rate = 2 / 1.5 = 1.33 USD/GBP

If the current exchange rate is different from this value, it suggests that one currency is undervalued or overvalued compared to the other.

### Advantages of PPP

1. **Comparison of Living Standards**: PPP provides a better comparison of living standards between countries by considering the price differences of the same goods and services.

2. **Currency Valuation**: It helps in assessing whether a currency is undervalued or overvalued in comparison to other currencies.

3. **Inflation Adjustments**: PPP adjusts for inflation differences between countries, offering a more accurate way of comparing economic indicators.

### Limitations of PPP

1. **Non-Traded Goods**: PPP assumes that goods are identical in all countries, but in reality, goods and services differ widely between countries, especially in terms of quality and preferences.

2. **Market Imperfections**: Transportation costs, tariffs, and other market imperfections can prevent the law of one price from holding true.

3. **Short-Term Variations**: In the short run, exchange rates can be affected by speculative activities, government policies, and other factors that deviate from PPP predictions.
